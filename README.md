# Projects

## Project 1: GCF Algorithms

This project focused on finding the space and time efficiency of 3 algorithms that found the greatest common factor of two values. 

- Euclidean
- Consecutive Integer
- Middle School

## Project 2: Closest Pair

This project focused on finding the shortest distance between two points in a list using 2 algotithms. 

- Brute Force
- Efficient Closest Pair (Divide and Conquer)

## Project 3: Knapsack Problem

Project 3 was a lesson in different methods of solving the NP-Complete Knapsack Problem using 3 methods

- Brute Force
- Dynamic Programming
- Custom Method that is as good or better than Dynamic (for the single given set of values/weights)
